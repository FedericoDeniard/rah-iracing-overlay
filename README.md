# **RAH iRacing Overlay**

**iRacing Input Telemetry Overlay** is an open-source Python-based project that provides real-time telemetry from iRacing, displaying input data both through a web interface so you can put it on programs like OBS or screen overlay for using it on your game.

I just didn't wanted to pay for some overlays subcriptions to have the overlay that I actually wanted, so why not trying? I hope you feel the same, this is free of course ;)

## **Compilation**

You can compile your own modified version, or make use of the precompiled one you can find on releases of this repo.

### **Prerequisites**

Before compiling, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **iRacing SDK**: Install iRacing for telemetry data [here](https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk.git).
- **Requirements file**: You will find a requirements.txt file on the repo for you to get all the libraries.
  
### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaulArcos/rah-iracing-overlay.git
cd iracing-input-telemetry-overlay
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Compile into an EXE file**

```bash
python3.10.exe (or your version) build_exe.py
```

## **Usage**

Just open the .exe file like a normal windows program, you will be welcomed by an easy interace to open any of the overlays, as well as modify its position or opening it on their web version to get the link for OBS.

## Windows Security: Unblocking DLL Files

If you encounter errors related to `Python.Runtime.dll` or other DLL files failing to load, it might be due to Windows blocking these files after being downloaded from another computer.
It is always better to build your own version, but if you don't know or simply don't want to, you will have to do this.

### Steps to Unblock DLLs:
1. Navigate to the `.dll` files, e.g.:
   - `\RAH_Telemetry_Overlay_0.2.1_internal\pythonnet\runtime\Python.Runtime.dll`
   - all `.dll` files in `\RAH_Telemetry_Overlay_0.2.1_internal\webview\lib\`

2. Right-click each `.dll` file and select **Properties**.

3. In the **General** tab, check the **"Unblock"** checkbox at the bottom (if itâ€™s visible).

4. Click **OK**.

This is needed because Windows may block DLL files that come from another computer, causing the program to fail to load them properly.

## **Contributing**

I hope you want to take part on this journey! Everyone is welcome to add diferent overlays to show interesting data like stadings positions, predicted points... you name it! These are the steps you should do to make this posible:

Remember!! You will find another README file on /src/overlays with steps to implement new overlays as easy as posible!

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
 ```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```
4. Commit your changes
```bash
git commit -m "Add some feature"
```
5. Pust your changes!
```bash
git push origin feature-name
```
